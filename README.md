# Trophic Cascade Simulator (TCS)
 A simple computational model of the interactions between wolves, elk, and aspen trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

### Made in 2020 By Brandon Smith for his IB BIO HL IA

### Getting started
First, make sure Python 3.x is installed, to be certain on compatability, 3.8 is reccomended.

Numpy is a mandatory package for this program, so confirm that you have it installed.
If you do not have numpy, please install acording to these directions: https://numpy.org/install/

Next, download and unpack this repository onto your computer, and make a note of where you put the folder.
Open up your OS' terminal, and change your directory to that of Trophic_Cascade_Sim.
Running TCS is as easy as running main.py using the python interpreter in your command line.

### Running TCS in windows command line would look something like this:
 ```
whatever\directory\Trophic_Cascade_Sim>python main.py
```
Once main.py is launched, TCS will guide you through the rest and begin the simulation!

Dont be worried if TCS is taking longer than an hour, that's completly normal. Yellowstone has a lot of organisims!

A .csv file will be created with all logged data inside of the folder for easy data analysis.

GLHF!
